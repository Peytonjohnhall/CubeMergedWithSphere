"""
Author: Peyton J. Hall (C).
A python program which 3 dimensionally graphs New Jerusalem 
on Mount Zion, at 31Â°46'40"N Latitude, in proportion with 
the radius of the earth at that given line of latitude. 
The graph emphasizes the fact that it would not be feasible
to enter through the gates of New Jerusalem without staircases
connecting the perimeter of the cube's base with the earth.
