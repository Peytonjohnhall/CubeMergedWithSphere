Introduction and statement of purpose:

In terms of geometry, the following passage sparks curiosity:

Revelation 21:16 KJV "And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: 
and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth 
and the height of it are equal."

A "furlong" is translated from the Greek tongue, by Bible scholars James Strong and Joseph Henry Thayer, as thus:

Furlong: στάδιον (Strong's G4712, Thayer's Greek Lexicon) "stad'-ee-on" - A measure of length 
comprising 600 Greek feet, or 625 Roman feet, or 125 Roman paces (Pliny, h. n. 2, 23 (21), 85), 
hence, one-eighth of a Roman mile (i. e. 606 3/4 English feet (about 15 miles less than one-fifth 
of a kilometer)); the space or distance of that length (A. V. a furlong).

Let us assume this perfect cube merges with the earth at mount Zion (31°46'40"N 35°14'07"E) based on the following passages:
Psalm 118:20, 2 Esdras 13:36, Isaiah 46:13, Isaiah 60:11, Revelation 21:1, Revelation 21:12-13, Revelation 21:18, and Revelation 21:25.

Note: At 31°46'40"N Latitude, where mount Zion stands, the earth's average radius at ground level is approximately
20,906,306.39764 English feet, or 3,959.527726825757782 miles.

Let us use latitude in visualization of the given data. Implementing algebraic functions into 
(a) Python program(s) is an efficient method in precisely visualizing the concept of these data.

If a perfect cube, of this gigantic size, were to merge with the earth, being an oblate spheroid, the extent in 
which the entire perimeter of the base of the cube is elevated off of the earth would make it impossible 
to walk through the gates. That is, unless if a series of staircases or ramps were in place to provide 
access in and out of the cube. 

Therefore, this GitHub repository hypothetically explores the angles in which staircases could be in place 
and the approximate lengths that these staircases would need to be. Granted, it is assumed that the average
radius of the earth will remain almost indentical to what it currently is, and has been for billions of years.
