Introduction and statement of purpose:

Revelation 21:16 KJV "And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: 
and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth 
and the height of it are equal."

Furlong: στάδιον (Strong's G4712, Thayer's Greek Lexicon) "stad'-ee-on" - A measure of length 
comprising 600 Greek feet, or 625 Roman feet, or 125 Roman paces (Pliny, h. n. 2, 23 (21), 85), 
hence, one-eighth of a Roman mile (i. e. 606 3/4 English feet (about 15 miles less than one-fifth 
of a kilometer)); the space or distance of that length (A. V. a furlong).

Let us assume this perfect cube merges with the earth on mount Zion (31°46'40"N 35°14'07"E) based on the following passages:
Psalm 118:20, 2 Esdras 13:36, Isaiah 46:13, Isaiah 60:11, Revelation 21:1, Revelation 21:12-14, Revelation 21:18, and Revelation 21:25.

Note: At 31°46'40"N Latitude, where mount Zion stands, the earth's average radius at ground level is approximately
20,906,306.39764 feet or 3,959.527726825757782 miles.

Let us use latitude in visualizing the given data. Implementing algebraic functions into 
(a) Python program(s) is an efficient method in precisely visualizing the concept of these data.
